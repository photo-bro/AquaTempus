# AquaTempus
Cross platform GUI application for tracking swim sets

Project Status:
Unfinished and unattended. Will possibly pick up and finish at a later date

NOTE:
AquaTempus is/was a project I began as a way of keeping my programming skills from atrophying. Unfortunately I became busy with other priorities and haven't worked on this project for quite some time.

Current State:
Pre-alpha. Work towards implementing a more precise and accurate cross-platform timing system is being done.

Purpose:
For the swimmers out there, have you ever been swimming laps alone and had trouble keeping track of your sets and intervals? AquaTempus is the answer for you. With AquaTempus keeping track of intervals and sets is a breeze! Simply write out your set to a .txt file in the AQ format and AquaTempus does the rest. The goal of AquaTempus is to allow you to focus on your workout and technique, not memorizing intervals and thinking about when to go or how much rest you have left.

Features:
- Mac OS X (and eventually Windows) compatability.
- Simple Easy-to-use Interface
- Precise and accurate interval timing
- Tracking of various stats including total and cumulative distance swam
